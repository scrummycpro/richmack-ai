Our technology

Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your experience

Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.

We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again. You also have the below experience and skills:

    Four+ years of experience working in Ruby on Rails

    Builder of scalable, efficient, and maintainable architectures

    Experience developing features at a high-growth SaaS company

    Active collaborator with product teams

Your work at Aha!

We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. As Lead Ruby on Rails Engineer, your work will include:

    Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed

    Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React

    Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape

    Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use

    Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation

    Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency

If the Lead Ruby on Rails Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)
Grow with us

Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. It is why we joined Aha! and how we achieve our very best.

We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.

    The base salary range for this role in the US is between $140,000 and $200,000.

    Cash-based compensation also includes profit sharing, and we contribute a percentage of your total pay each month toward your retirement.

    Medical, dental, and vision plans (for many teammates, we cover 100% of the premiums)

    Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want

    30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave

    Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning

    Volunteer opportunities throughout the year

Base salary and total compensation are dependent upon many factors, including skills, experience, and relevant past roles.

They make a difference in the lives of their customers, their communities and with our organization as a whole. That's why we look for team members with an entrepreneurial spirit and a passion to build successful partnerships with our clients. Because at the end of the day our goal is to help our partners businesses run better.

At TriumphPay, we are building the transportation payments network for the future. Our software touches a combined $37.1B in annualized freight volume, representing over 20% of the brokered freight market in the U.S. TriumphPay’s customers are using our products to solve real world problems. This is both exciting and also an incredible responsibility.

We are looking for experienced full-stack engineers to join our team of 35+ engineers. If you join TriumphPay, you will work closely in a team of 3-5 people on a specific project. Teams are responsible for managing their own backlogs and schedule. To develop a breadth of experience, our engineers rotate on a quarterly basis. A rotation gives the team a chance to work with others, and work on a variety of projects, sometimes utilizing differing technologies.

A Day In The Life:

We love curious individuals who believe they can always improve, and we know that good developers are capable of picking up new languages and tools.

Engineers are provided a top of the line MacBook to do their work, and you’ll have access to all the necessary tooling to do the non-coding parts of your job (Zoom, Slack, etc.).

To succeed in this role, you should be:

    Curious. You aren't content with the status quo and know that we can always improve.

    Collaborative. You can work with others to improve a solution.

    Empathetic. Your designs are influenced by a deep understanding of the customers' needs.

    A strong communicator. You will proactively communicate issues and trade-offs with team members to support alignment and fast decision making.

    Be an outstanding developer. Your peers should recognize you as one of the best and the brightest developers they have worked with.

    A superb problem solver, with a knack for technical innovation.

Bonus points for:

    Leading an engineering team or running a consulting company.

    Experience with functional languages like Elm, Haskell, OCaml, or Elixir.

    Profit-sharing bonus. We set aside a pot of money at the end of each year based on profits and distribute bonuses according to a formula that uses as inputs your level within the company and the length of your tenure at the company.

    Hardware budget. We'll buy you a brand new state-of-the-art 16" Apple MacBook Pro (or other computer of your choosing of equivalent value) upon joining. It will be owned by you, not the company.
