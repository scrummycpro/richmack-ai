I. Devops is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

II. In the context of PySpark, Devops is:
   A. Is associated with: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which allow for frequent code releases and testing in a production-like environment.
   B. Should be associated with: Version control systems like Git and tools for automating deployments and containerization such as Docker and Kubernetes.
   C. Is not directly related to: Writing PySpark code itself but rather the process of building, testing, and deploying PySpark applications.
   D. Should not be associated with: Manual deployment processes or lack of automation in software development and delivery.
