# Document Analyzer

This Python script creates a simple GUI application for analyzing text documents using the OLLAMA natural language processing (NLP) library and SQLite for data storage.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- OLLAMA library
- SQLite3

## Installation
1. Install Python if not already installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install ollama
   ```
3. No additional installation steps are required for SQLite3 and tkinter as they are included in Python's standard library.

## Usage
1. Run the script `document_analyzer.py`.
2. Click the "Browse" button to select a text document (.txt).
3. Click the "Analyze" button to analyze the selected document.
4. The analysis result will be displayed on the screen.
5. The analysis result along with the document content and timestamp will be saved to a SQLite database named `document_analysis.db`.

## Structure
- `document_analyzer.py`: Main Python script containing the `DocumentAnalyzerApp` class which creates the GUI application.
- `document_analysis.db`: SQLite database for storing analysis results.

## Functionality
- Allows users to select a text document for analysis.
- Analyzes the selected document using the OLLAMA library.
- Displays the analysis result.
- Saves the document content, analysis result, and timestamp to a SQLite database.

## Note
